### Exercise 5 - Quantum Information and Computing 2020/2021 ###

## Eigenproblem & Random Matrix Theory ##
The aim of this program is to study the distribution of normalized spacings of eigenvalues of different type of random matrices. 
The 2 types considered are: HERMITIAN matrix and DIAGONAL matrix.


# Files description: #
- Ex5-Guadagnini-NormSpacings-CODE.f90 : 
    contains the module "NormSpacings" that defines the subroutines to compute eigenvalues, normalized spacings, probability distribution and to save results on file.
    in details:
    *  RandInitHermitianMat: it initializes the matrix as upper complex hermitian triangular;
    *  HermEigenvalues     : it computes eigenvalues using the ZHEEV subroutine from LAPACK;
    *  NormSpacings        : it computes the normalized spacings between an array;
    *  ComputePDF          : it computes the probability distribution from an array of data;
    *  PrintColumnsOnFile  : it prints probability and mid position of bins on file.
    
- Ex5-Guadagnini-Debugger-CODE.f90 :
    contains the module "Debugger" that defines two subroutines to be used in the program.
    *  InitDebugger: it prints a message stating that debugging is active and explaining its usage;
    *  Checkpoint  : it prints a message when called only if the logical flag "Debug" is .TRUE.;
    *  CatchError  : called when something goes wrong, it prints a message on screen and if it is a fatal error also on a file before stopping the execution.
    
- Ex5-Guadagnini-CODE.f90 : 
    contains the main program that reads the size of the matrix and number of bins from command line. If command arguments are not present or invalid it uses defaults.
    Then it calls the subroutines that do the actual task. It is divided into three parts: 
    * reading command line arguments to set Matrix size, number of bins and debug flag;
    * diagonal matrix spacings computaton;
    * hermitian matrix spacings computation.
    
- Ex5-Guadagnini-SpacingsFit.gnu :
    gnuplot script to fit the computed distribution with the suggested model and produce the fit plot and the residuals plot.
    It receives as input three arguments: name of the file containing data, max x and max y values.
        
- HermSpacings.dat & DiagSpacings.dat :
    these files contains the distributions computed by the program from the Hermitian matrix and the Diagonal matrix respectively.

   
# Compile instructions: #
To compile use :
    gfortran *CODE.f90 -o RandMatTheory.x -lblas - llapack [-O3 -fcheck=all -Wall] 
    
Note:
the flag "-Ofast" produces bad results (NaN)

    
# Execute instructions: #
- FORTRAN:
    To run use :
        ./RandMatTheory.x [Size] [# of bins] [debug flag]
    where "Size" and "# of bins" must be an integer number and "debug flag" must be "TRUE" in order to activate debug.
    Example: 
        ./RandMatTheory.x 10000 150
        
    The programcan also be called without arguments; in this case it uses defaults and it is equivalent to:
        ./RandMatTheory.x 200 20
    
- GNUPLOT:
    To run the gnuplot script:
        gnuplot -c Ex5-Guadagnini-SpacingsFit.gnu datafile xmax ymax
    Examples:
        gnuplot -c Ex5-Guadagnini-SpacingsFit.gnu HermSpacings.dat 4.1 1.2
        gnuplot -c Ex5-Guadagnini-SpacingsFit.gnu DiagSpacings.dat 5.1 1.2
