    script to be called by Ex4-Guadagnini-AutoFitScript.py; it fits the data in the file provided as argument and produce the corresponding plot;
- Ex4-Guadagnini-AutoFitScript.py: 
    it runs gnuplot with the instructions contained in "AutoFit.gnu", passing to it datafiles and renaming the "fit.log" files accordingly;
    
# to run python script that produces the fits:
